# Premier-League-Player-Statistics-Dashboard

## Problem And Motivation
Sport Analytics is a very lucrative industry and has been getting a lot of attention lately. With millions spent in scouting players, betting, sports journalism and games like fantasy leagues, analytics in sports is here to stay. This project focuses on the English Premier League, the most popular and viewed association football league in the world. The project aims to visualize player statistics to provide insights in their playing style, form, and performance. There are many platforms and apps that show player statistics in tabular forms. There are hardly any openly available apps that visualize this data and provide the myriad of insights that is hidden in this data. Most of these apps are behind paywalls and are hard to access for the football fans. This project aims to bridge this gap but mainly focuses on visualizing player statistics beyond tables into graphs and other novel visualization methods and present them on a dashboard. This will enable users to access the summary of the player statistics through multiple visualizations.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from this [link](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats). For each club in the English Premier League, we downloaded data for Standard Statistics, Passing, Defensive Actions and Possession as CSV files. These files were then merged and wrangled for each team such that we had one merged data set for each team. The datasets directory has a total of 20 teams.

## Tools/Technologies Used
The tools used in this project have been summarized below.

• Python was used as the primary programming language. 

• The pandas library was used for data preprocessing and wrangling.

• The SciPy library was used to carry out computations like finding rank of a value.

• Matplotlib and Plotly were used to create visualizations.

• Dash was used as the backend for creating the dashboard application along with the Python programming language.
